# Week 1 - Hello API üêí

This application shows data from the [Rijksmuseum API](https://rijksmuseum.github.io/). This API contains i.a. detailed information about the collection, including images and colors found in these images. The application now shows the first 100 **paintings** that contains the color #737C84 (grey/blue);

## Data

To retrieve the data from the API I used an `XMLHttpRequest`. Later I made a promise based `XMLHttpRequest`.

## `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR)

With an `XMLHttpRequest` you can retrieve any type of data from a URL (without having to do a full page refresh). You can see how I created this request [here](link).

### Promise based XHR

When working with APIs, promises help avoid deeply nested callbacks, aka "Callback Hell". Promises allow you to chain methods together using `.then()`. You can see how I created an Promise based request [here](link).

I also tried two different ways for rendering the data in the HTML:

1. With `document.createElement()` and `element.append()`, which you can see in [this file](www.google.com)
2. With template literals, whick you can find in [this file](www.google.com)
